# RescueOps / FAFIQ — Execution Index

This folder contains the authoritative execution roadmap for the project.

## Canonical context (must be read first)
- Fafik_System_Context.md
- project_context.md
- implementation_plan.md
- rls.md
- schema.md
- storage.md

## Execution phases (must be followed in order)
1. phase_0_prerequisites.md
2. phase_1_visual_mvp.md
3. phase_2_backend_integration.md
4. phase_3_operations_and_polish.md

## Rules for AI agents
- Do not skip phases
- Do not weaken RLS or audit guarantees
- UI built in Phase 1 must not be rewritten in Phase 2
- Update status fields as work progresses
